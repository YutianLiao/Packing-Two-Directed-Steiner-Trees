# Packing-Two-Directed-Steiner-Trees

## About

---

This repository contains the core algorithms and related test data from my master's thesis. The research focuses on optimizing data transmission stability and efficiency, specifically addressing the Steiner tree problem in directed graphs. The objective is to minimize total cost while finding (packing) two edge-disjoint trees. This repository includes:

1. **Algorithm Implementation**: Detailed code for the algorithm based on the optimization methods proposed in the thesis

2. **Test Data**: Randomly generated test data and links for benchmark datasets

3. **Documentation and Notes**: Includes relevant theories, algorithm derivations, and experimental result analysis from the thesis
